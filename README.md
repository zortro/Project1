# Oceans Of Knowledge

A spin on an oldy but a goody -- Trivia Game.
Only, this game has several unusual twists to keep the audience captivated while they wait for their meals to arrive (HINT: give SeaSick a try and/or get help;) 
<!-- // hahahaha -->

# FUNCTIONALITY:
We have procured the muscle of two API'S to the site to let them do the heavy lifting. API'S sit between an application and the web server, acting as an intermediary layer that processes data transfer between systems.

The User Interface is easy to follow and works flawlessly.

# SCREEEN FUNCTIONALITY
We have adjusted the viewing portal to accomadate multiple screen sizes.

# Trivia-page
If normal mode is selected, 3 random answers will generate and 1 correct one in a Grid under the question.
IF SeaSick Mode is Selected, the same random 3 and 1 real answer will generate but they will be floating around in the water trying to be caught by your mouse. 

# Random USELESS Fact
IT"S OUR GAME-- Why not offer a life-line? 
For your pure entertainment we have added a get help button so that we can populate a completely useless fact that has less than 0.5 percent chance of helping you with your current question.

# Marketing ideas
    - An outright sale to the McDonald's Corporation to enhance their current twitter craze surrounding the word "McFish". 

    If no bite, We could utilitize the same platform to approach either Darden Restraunt chain who are International, and change our mascot name to match, or go localized to bars and grills. There is $ in both arenas.
